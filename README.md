# Angular runtime Dynamic Module Loading

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.8.

Original codes are adopted from https://github.com/lmeijdam/angular-umd-dynamic-example

Objective:
This project is an effort to develop an angular environment for developing modules that can be dynamically loaded at run time.  The laodable modules should be generated by angular and reusable as *.umd.js files.
Earlier this has been done successfully at https://github.com/lmeijdam/angular-umd-dynamic-example with an earlier version of angular and systemjs.  The same codes no longer works after angular 8 and systemjs v>2.
Given what had worked earlier, it is hoped there is a way to make modifications in the original codes to work with angular 9 and above.
If possible, this opens a wide posibilities.

Notes:
1. Currently the project is compiling ok and loading correctly excepte contents for the dynamically loaded modules are not showing.
2. Limited to older versions of systemjs. Using version '0.21.5'
3. You have to recreate the modules in the 'projects' directory using the cli v-11.2.9
